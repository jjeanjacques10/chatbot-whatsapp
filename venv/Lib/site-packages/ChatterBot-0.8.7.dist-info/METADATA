        # ChatterBot
        
        ChatterBot is a machine-learning based conversational dialog engine build in
        Python which makes it possible to generate responses based on collections of
        known conversations. The language independent design of ChatterBot allows it
        to be trained to speak any language.

        An example of typical input would be something like this:
        
        > **user:** Good morning! How are you doing?  
        > **bot:**  I am doing very well, thank you for asking.  
        > **user:** You're welcome.  
        > **bot:** Do you like hats?  
        
        ## How it works
        
        An untrained instance of ChatterBot starts off with no knowledge of how to communicate. Each time a user enters a statement, the library saves the text that they entered and the text that the statement was in response to. As ChatterBot receives more input the number of responses that it can reply and the accuracy of each response in relation to the input statement increase. The program selects the closest matching response by searching for the closest matching known statement that matches the input, it then returns the most likely response to that statement based on how frequently each response is issued by the people the bot communicates with.
        
        ## Installation
        
        This package can be installed from [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ChatterBot) by running:
        
        ```
        pip install chatterbot
        ```
        
        ## Basic Usage
        
        ```
        from chatterbot import ChatBot
        
        chatbot = ChatBot(
            'Ron Obvious',
            trainer='chatterbot.trainers.ChatterBotCorpusTrainer'
        )
        
        # Train based on the english corpus
        chatbot.train("chatterbot.corpus.english")
        
        # Get a response to an input statement
        chatbot.get_response("Hello, how are you today?")
        ```
        
        # Training data
        
        ChatterBot comes with a data utility module that can be used to train chat bots.
        At the moment there is three languages, English, Spanish and Portuguese training data in this module. Contributions
        of additional training data or training data in other languages would be greatly
        appreciated. Take a look at the data files in the
        [chatterbot-corpus](https://github.com/gunthercox/chatterbot-corpus)
        package if you are interested in contributing.
        
        ```
        # Train based on the english corpus
        chatbot.train("chatterbot.corpus.english")
        
        # Train based on english greetings corpus
        chatbot.train("chatterbot.corpus.english.greetings")
        
        # Train based on the english conversations corpus
        chatbot.train("chatterbot.corpus.english.conversations")
        ```

        # History
        
        See release notes for changes https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/releases
        
        # Development pattern for contributors
        
        1. [Create a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of
           the [main ChatterBot repository](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot) on GitHub.
        2. Make your changes in a branch named something different from `master`, e.g. create
           a new branch `my-pull-request`.
        3. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
        4. Please follow the [Python style guide for PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
        5. Use the projects [built-in automated testing](https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing.html)
           to help make sure that your contribution is free from errors.
